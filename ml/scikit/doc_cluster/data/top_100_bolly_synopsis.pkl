All they have to help them is their hope, confidence and some kindness in the society along with Uncle Narayan who is blind. Tragedy strikes their lives as well when they lose their first child thanks to Kanu's greed. But they never give up hope on life and not in one instance during the entire movie do they think about ending it. They live life, fight it and succeed in it at a bigger scale than any normal person.  \n "

S" Plot  [edit]  [  [  edit  edit  ]  ]  \n  Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) are students of the fictional Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of the best engineering colleges in India. Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer, but is instead pursuing an engineering degree to appease his father. Raju works towards the degree because he needs to improve his family's financial situation but consistently gets low grades due to his insecurities. Their third room-mate and friend, Ranchodas 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), is unique in actually taking joy in building machines. Rancho incurs the wrath of the college's director, Viru 'Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), by giving creative and unorthodox answers in class and living by the philosophy that one should pursue excellence, not success, as success will follow if excellence is achieved. Virus is described as an extremely strict person - so strict, that he caused his son's suicide due to putting excess pressure on him. Virus's star student is Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), not-so-affectionately known as 'Silencer' for his silent but malodorous farts in addition to his arrogant attitude. Chatur wants to impress his professors by excelling at rote recitation. Unknown to him, Rancho modifies the written speech by replacing praise with obscene phrases. Chatur obliviously memorizes and delivers the modified speech, thus humiliating himself. Afterwards, he vows revenge against Rancho. Meanwhile, Rancho falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor), a doctor, whom the trio meet when they gatecrash a wedding, unaware that the wedding they crashed was that of Virus's eldest daughter Mona (Mona Singh). In fact, Pia is also his younger daughter. Virus tries to break the trio up but despite the challenges they face, the three manage to stand firm. Later Virus concedes defeat after he and the combined efforts of the students manage to deliver his grandson by using their practical engineering knowledge during a storm. Virus eventually gives Rancho his treasured space pen and acknowledges him as an extraordinary student.  Farhan Qureshi (  R. Madhavan  R.

Rancho disappeared shortly after their graduation and effectively out of their lives. As they travel, they manage to find clues about Rancho's true identity. It is revealed that the original Rancho (Javed Jaffrey) was the real Ranchodas. The Rancho they know was a servant to the Chanchad household and studied in the ICE in the original Rancho's name when the latter went to London for 4 years.

S" Plot  [edit]  [  [  edit  edit  ]  ]  \n  Professor Parimal Tripathi (Dharmendra) is a botany professor who falls in love with Sulekha Chaturvedi (Sharmila Tagore) during a women's college botany excursion. Prof. Parimal Tripathi helps the bungalow watchman to get to his village downhill to enable him to see his grandson who's fallen ill. Meanwhile he disguises himself as the bungalow watchman to protect the old man's job. Sulekha finds out one day about the cover-up and is charmed on seeing Parimal's real personality. They both get married. Parimal loves playing pranks and is the antithesis of regular professors. Sulekha, on the other hand is in awe of her jijaji (brother-in-law) Raghavendra (Om Prakash). She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya (David Abraham Cheulkar) asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa (Keshto Mukherjee) uses improper grammar. This provides the perfect opportunity for Parimal to get to see and interact with jijaji. Parimal becomes Pyaremohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji.

Pyaremohan's excessively refined Hindi, his habit of correcting Jijaji's usage of the language and his persistence in getting jijaji to teach him English all serve to irk Jijaji to no end and provide for many laughs. Parimal's long-time friend P K Srivastava (Asrani) is also party to the prank. His sister-in-law Vasudha (Jaya Bachchan) suspects fake 'Parimal' - Sukumar Sinha - of infidelity to his wife 'Sulekha' when he tries to get close to her. Sukumar falls in love with Vasudha who at first believed he was Parimal, but Sukumar reveals to her the real drama behind all this mix-up of situations. Lata Srivastava (Lily Chakravarty), P K Srivastava's wife, is also angered over the latest 'extra-marital' love affair. But toward the end, Sukumar and Vasudha end up marrying in a temple where Haripat Bhaiyya coerces Pyaremohan to 'kill' himself so that Parimal could surface. Thus jijaji comes to comprehend the whole enactment, finally admitting that he was truly fooled. The film revolves around the resolution of these funny mishaps.

S" Plot  [edit]  [  [  edit  edit  ]  ]  \n  Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher) is a middle-class man living in New Delhi. He is a simple man with simple tastes. The film begins with a dream sequence where Khosla sees his death, the irony being that nobody really cares about his demise; instead his children and neighbours are more occupied with banal small talk. Waking up from this nightmare, Khosla goes to visit a site where he has purchased a plot of land to build a house. He is accompanied by his family \xe2\x80\x94 wife, elder son Balwant a.k.a. Bunty (Ranvir Shorey), younger son Chironji Lal a.k.a. Cherry (Parvin Dabas) (who does not like his name and wishes to change it), and his daughter. Kamal Kishore has invested all of his savings (Rs.3 million) into buying the plot; Cherry is not too interested in his father's future plans of settling together in the new house. He is a software engineer and, although a source of pride for his father, he finds his current lifestyle too drab and has planned to shift to the US by taking up a job there. However, he has not let his family in on his plans. The only person Cherry discusses his plan with are Asif Iqbal (Vinay Pathak), the agent helping him with his passport and visa paperwork. Much later, he shares this with his close friend Meghna (Tara Sharma) \xe2\x80\x94 who has a very visible romantic interest in him (one which he does not seem to fully realise) \xe2\x80\x94 she, however, feels hurt and angered by his choice to desert her and his family.

Probing further reveals that the squatters are part of a property usurping nexus headed by the corrupt and powerful Kishan Khurana (Boman Irani). Upon being urged so by the property dealer who had facilitated the purchase of the plot, Kamal Kishore and Bunty visit Khurana. Khurana places before them, a demand for Rs.1.5\xc2\xa0million to vacate the plot, an amount which Khosla neither has nor agrees to pay. Kamal Kishore appeals to authorities and agencies, including the police, lawyers, political parties, NGOs and social activists for help. None of them offers more than to get the amount demanded by Khurana reduced by a few lacs, in exchange for a hefty commission for mediating, of course.

None of them offers more than to get the amount demanded by Khurana reduced by a few lacs, in exchange for a hefty commission for mediating, of course.  \n  Spurred by his father's helplessness, Bunty gets help from a gang of local strongmen (pahalwans) who demolish the boundary walls built by Khurana's men and take possession of the plot back by force. This success is short-lived as the corrupt Khurana has the police in his pocket and Kamal Kishore is arrested on trumped up charges of trespass. Released at Khurana's guileful behest after spending a day in the jail, Khosla's will is broken and pride battered. After the catastrophic event Khosla tells his family (especially Cherry) to avoid taking any further action as he is not capable of fighting back and wants Cherry to concentrate on the job that he's arranging abroad. Cherry discusses the grim situation with Asif Iqbal who is revealed to have been an old partner of Khurana's and who has been cheated by him, usurping Asif's own ancestral land. Asif offers to help the Khoslas with a group of Meghna's friends, and they set up a plan to deceive Khurana. They portray a land (owned by the fisheries department, but which has been vacant since decades) as their own, and seek help of Meghna's mentor, Bapu (Navin Nischol) to portray himself as the owner of the land, who is looking for a buyer. The deal is almost finalised, and Khurana requests to visit the land. With the help of the rest of the theatre group, they manage to create a situation which makes Khurana believe of the authenticity of the land and its owner. They successfully turn the tables on Khurana, and dupe him of Rs 3.5 million in cash. From that money, Kamal Kishore pays the ransom 1.2\xc2\xa0million to Khurana and gets possession of his plot back, and the remaining cash is divided equally between Asif and the theatre group.

One fine day he comes across Prabha Narayan (Vidya Sinha) at the bus stop en route to work and it\'s love at first sight... for Arun that is. Lacking enough courage and unsure if his feelings are reciprocated, he pines for her from afar and follows her around, at a safe distance (or so he thinks).

It doesn\'t help that he appears to be miles ahead of Arun in the "race" and is all that Arun is not: He\'s gregarious while Arun is shy, he\'s confident and boastful, while Arun is besieged with self-doubt, he\'s smooth, while Arun is awkward, he\'s street smart, while Arun\'s na\xc3\xafve, he\'s assertive while Arun is timid. Plus he owns a scooter and ensures that he has opportunities to offer Prabha a ride, while Arun can only look on. A gullible Arun, trying to match Nagesh with a motorbike of his own, is conned into buying a dud, further embarrassing him in front of Prabha.

After years of drought, the region finally gets rain, leading the farmers to rejoice. Shambu owns two bighas (two-thirds of an acre of land) of land, which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local zamindar (landlord) Thakur Harnam Singh (Murad) partners with some city business men to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return would profit them and bring prosperity to the village.

Shambu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambu and proposes Shambu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt.

Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items including his wife's gold earrings. When Shambu meets Harman Singh's accountant to pay back his debt of 65 rupees, he's shocked to know that he actually owes 235 rupees. The accountant had forged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labour provided by Shambu's father Gangu as portion of debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambu, being an illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant forged the numbers and how he took to the accountant's word of mouth and did not demand any receipt. Shambu loses the case and the judge orders Shambu to pay 235 rupees to Harnam Singh in three months. If Shambu is not able to clear the debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts.

One of his friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambu likes this idea, but faces resistance from his wife as she's pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambu persuades her that he'll be gone for three months only and it would benefit his family and the soon-to-be-born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambu finds Kanhaiya hiding and hitchhiking with him and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him.

Krishna buys Kanji\'s house from the bank, but allows Kanji to stay with him.  \n  The lawsuit causes a public outcry. As Kanji and Krishna watch this on TV, Krishna advises him to go to the media and present his views to the public. Kanji\'s interview receives wide coverage and public opinion swings in his favour. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, whose insurance claims were rejected due to "Act Of God" show up at Hanif Qureshi\'s house and join the lawsuit. Kanji agrees to fight on behalf of all of them. In the next court session, Catholic priests and Muslim Mullahs are also summoned to the court as defendants. However, lawyer Sardesai points out that Kanji has no document that can prove the disaster was an "Act of God". The judge orders Kanji to present a written proof that will support his claim.

He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule.  \n  Bhuvan thus begins to prepare the villagers for the match. He initially finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell\'s sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the people in the villages. As she teaches them the rules of the game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the anguish of Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is also in love with Gauri. In an attempt to discredit Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villagers\' team to destroy it. Eventually, as the villagers realise that winning equals freedom, and as a few of them are insulted by the British, they soon join the team. Still short one player, Bhuvan invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl spinners. The villagers, conditioned by long term prejudice against untouchables, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.

On the first day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British officers a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball, because new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (such as those the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. During the evening, however, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha\'s deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.

However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the collapse of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings.

S' Plot  [edit]  [  [  edit  edit  ]  ]  \n  Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta) is a bespectacled 23-year-old Punjabi MBA student who is quite pessimistic and cynical towards her life and relationships. The movie opens up to Naina visiting Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City. She relates how whenever she misses her father, she comes to the park. Upon returning home, we see Jenny (Jaya Bachchan), Naina\'s widowed mother who is on the phone discussing a loan extension for their centrally situated restaurant which isn\'t doing so well. Upon Naina\'s father\'s passing, all the house\'s responsibilities have fallen on her. Naina begins looking through the mail to find another private and confidential letter addressed to her mother, among many others she periodically receives. She also finds a letter from a Punjabi matrimonial service, Kunwari Kudi (meaning: Single Girl) that her grandmother and her aunts have enlisted in hopes of marrying off Naina to a Sikh sardar man. Naina\'s grandmother Lajjo (Sushma Seth), and Naina\'s aunts Kammo (Shoma Anand) and Vimmo (Kamini Khanna) are religious aspiring musicians who often perform for their neighbor, Chadda (Dara Singh) and to the horror and inconvenience of many of their other neighbors. There are also Naina\'s younger siblings in the home, including Shiv (Athit Naik), Naina\'s disabled biological brother and Gia (Jhanak Shukla), Naina\'s adoptive sister. There is much tension in the Kapur household as Lajjo is resentful towards Gia and Jenny as she believes Jenny\'s decision to adopt Gia is what led to her husband\'s suicide and the failing financial condition of their family, thus causing her to be affectionate with Naina and Shiv, while being cold to Gia. She thinks that Gia is the main problem in the house. She believes that the problems in the house started after Gia is adopted. There is also much religious tension in the house as Jenny practices Christianity while Lajjo practices Sikhism.

Meanwhile, Aman is seen speaking with a woman, Priya (Sonali Bendre) discussing important things although it is not known what this might be. Naina is initially reluctant to enjoy Aman\'s presence, as he has helped her family so much, taught her how to accept happiness in life, and even given her the confidence to dress brightly and even lose her glasses. She grows to like him and eventually falls in love with him. Also, Rohit, has begun to notice Naina\'s new outlook and optimism on life, and he too begins to fall in love with her.

The story is relayed by a series of flashbacks.  \n  Jaswant Singh Randhawa (Raj Zutshi) and his sister Veerendar "Veeran" (Tabu) live with their elderly mother Biji in a small village in Punjab. Kripal Singh (Chandrachur Singh) is Jaswant\'s childhood friend and Veeran\'s fiance and lives close by, with his grandfather. Their peaceful lives are interrupted by the police led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra, searching for Jimmy, who allegedly had attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the Indian Parliament. Jaswant mockingly leads the police to his dog who was named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant for questioning but he fails to return for days. Kripal struggles to locate Jaswant, visiting various police stations in the area, while taking care of Jaswant\'s family. When Jaswant finally returns after 15 days, he has been badly beaten up by police which enrages Kripal. Unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, Kripal sets off to locate his cousin Jeetay, who had ties with militant groups. Unable to locate Jeetay, Kripal instead encounters a man named Sanathan (Om Puri), whom he observes planting a time-bomb on a bus. Running into him again at a dhabha, Kripal asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck being driven by the "Commander" (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and carrying sacks of home-made bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that Jeetay was killed by the Commander himself for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal\'s background, family and his predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers and tells him to go kill Khurana himself, but that the group would protect him. Kripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group and Sanathan, who explains that he is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause, but for his basic civil rights and self-respect. Sanathan says that he is fighting against a system that victimises innocents and de-values ordinary people. It is later learned that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence that occurred with the Partition of India in 1947, wherein he lost most of his family in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class that is trying to divide society by religion for political gain.

The Commander informs Kripal that he is known to the police, who had taken Jaswant in for questioning again. Kripal slowly begins to realise that there is no return to a normal life and finds solace in the company of the rest of the unit, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting the arrival of a missile firing specialist.

There, a fight arises between the accused and Bacha Yadav and his colleagues. It reaches an extreme point with Bacha Yadav piercing the eyes of the accused and pouring acid, referred locally as "Gangaajal", on their eyes. The incident raises a hue and cry in the local media, which accuses Police of vigilante justice. Angered by the incident, Amit Kumar orders his men involved to give their confessions in writing. While all, except Bacha Yadav, deny their involvement, Bacha Yadav writes his confession in a letter and submits it to Amit. When Bacha Yadav reaches his home, he finds his son and wife taken hostage by Sundar Yadav who, after a brief struggle, kills Bacha Yadav by shooting in his eyes. Enraged by the incident, Amit Kumar burns the confession letter of Bacha Yadav and issues a search warrant for Sundar and warns Sadhu Yadav to tell Sundar to surrender himself. Sadhu Yadav applies for an anticipatory bail for Sundar but before Sundar is produced in the court, he is arrested and is taken to jail. This time, the court rejects the bail application and orders the Police to keep Sundar in a 10-day custody.

This time, the court rejects the bail application and orders the Police to keep Sundar in a 10-day custody.  \n  However, Sadhu Yadav influences local home minister and the Deputy Inspector-in-General (Mohan Agashe) of the area, Verma, to release his son and also to send Amit on an emergency leave. After being released, Sundar disrupts the marriage of the girl who he kidnapped earlier and kills her mother in the process. Unable to bear the loss of her mother and the torture at the hands of Sundar, she kills herself in the presence of Amit. Amit detains both Sadhu and Sundar and tries to take them to Police Station. However, locals stop Amit and demand that both be killed then and there itself, before being convinced by him that they would be tried as per the law. On the way to Police Station, however, both Sadhu and Sundar escape. Amit then catches up with them and brief fight takes place between them and the film ends with both Sundar and Sadhu getting killed by falling accidentally on chisels of a plough, which incidentally pierce through their eyes.

With the directions in the letter, Arun, accompanied by his ward Jugal, enters his father\'s laboratory and finds the device. The device is in the shape of a gold watch worn on the wrist. When it is activated, it makes the wearer invisible to the naked eye. This invisibility is pervasive except for one flaw: when red light is focused on the wearer, he becomes visible. Arun and Jugal decide to keep the device a secret between them. Seema goes to a lavish party hosted by Teja and Daaga, where she performs a song under the guise of a Hawaiian dancer. She is nearly killed by the criminals after her disguise is spoiled, but Arun invisibly rescues her, styling himself "Mr. India".

Mogambo\'s computer-aided intelligence teams reveal that Mr. India\'s specific actions against the gambling den bring benefit to Arun Verma. Mogambo has bombs disguised as toys, planted in places where children can find them. One of the bombs kills Arun\'s youngest and dearest charge, Tina, driving Arun to immense grief. Arun, Seema, Calendar, and the surviving children are brought before Mogambo. Mogambo tortures them so that they reveal Mr. India\'s true identity and the location of the invisibility device. Arun eventually volunteers to this when Mogambo threatens to drop two children into a pit of acid; but because Arun has dropped the device, he cannot become invisible to prove himself.
